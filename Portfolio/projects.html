            <h4>
                Python Project: Tetris
            </h4>
            <p>
                I created a tetris game in Python, as it is a game i enjoyed when I was younger, and still find entertaining. The project was challenging, as it was my first time creating a full-size project using a GUI, but it was an entertaining challenge.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Web Project: Weather App
            </h4>
            <p>
                To train myself on handling APIs and displaying the informaition gained, I decided to create a webpage that would display the current weather data for any city. There were a few issues along the way, however I am satisfied with the outcome.

            <h4>
                SQL Project: Film Database
            </h4>
            <p>
                During my time learning databases I created this database to train myself on how to write SQL code that could be executed through another program.

            <h4>
                Collection Management Database
            </h4>
            <p>
                I wanted to create a database to help me manage a collection for one of my hobbies, so that I could see what items I already had and what I was missing. Once complete, I intend to expand the database to handle subsections of the collection.

            <h4>
                Mahjongg game
            </h4>
            <p>
                I learned how to play Mahjongg at a young age from my parents, who always played it on holiday. Since expanding my digital knowledge, I have noticed there are little to no resources to play the game online. I aim to create a framework to play the game online.

            <h4>
                Single Elimination Bracket Website
            </h4>
            <p>
                As a fan of a youtube group, I was previously entertained by a single-elimination tournament for a collection of their videos run by their fans. I wanted to create a website that could run similar tournaments, with functionalities to allow people to vote, and to remotely handle when each vote went live/closed.
